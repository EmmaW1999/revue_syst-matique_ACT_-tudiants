METHODS: Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-42) completed anonymously in the students' respective classrooms by 1,617 students.
RESULTS: Depression, anxiety and stress levels of moderate severity or above were found in 27.1, 47.1 and 27\% of our respondents, respectively. Anxiety and stress scores were higher among female students. First- and second-year students had higher depression, anxiety and stress scores than the others. Students who were satisfied with their education had lower depression, anxiety and stress scores than those who were not satisfied.
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms among university students is alarming. This shows the need for primary and secondary prevention measures, with the development of adequate and appropriate support services for this group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mental health problems in college and their associations with academic performance are not well understood. The main aim of this study was to investigate to what extent mental health problems are associated with academic functioning.
METHODS: As part of the World Mental Health Surveys International College Student project, 12-month mental health problems among freshmen (N = 4921) was assessed in an e-survey of students at KU Leuven University in Leuven, Belgium. The associations of mental health problems with academic functioning (expressed in terms of academic year percentage [or AYP] and grade point average [GPA]) were examined across academic departments.
RESULTS: Approximately one in three freshman reports mental health problems in the past year, with internalizing and externalizing problems both associated with reduced academic functioning (2.9-4.7\% AYP reduction, corresponding to 0.2-0.3 GPA reduction). The association of externalizing problems with individual-level academic functioning was significantly higher in academic departments with comparatively low average academic functioning.
LIMITATIONS: Limited sample size precluded further investigation of interactions between department-level and student-level variables. No information was available on freshman secondary school academic performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Mental health problems are common in college freshman, and clearly associated with lower academic functioning. Additional research is needed to examine the potentially causal nature of this association, and, if so, whether interventions aimed at treating mental health problems might improve academic performance.},

Les confinements ont augmenté les symptomatologies anxieuses et dépressives des étudiants Français. Au-delà des confinements, la situation sanitaire a augmenté la présence de symptômes anxieux chez les étudiants. Il semble que les étudiants aient augmenté leur temps d’activité physique et sportive durant le premier confinement, mais que cela ne soit pas maintenu dans le temps, même lors du second confinement. La crise sanitaire a eu pour conséquence d’augmenter les comportements sédentaires. Il est important pour les universités d’accompagner les étudiants dans la gestion de leurs émotions et de leur mode de vie. Dans ce manuscrit, des dispositifs innovants mis en place par l’université de Nîmes seront présentés.
Key points
Lockdowns increased symptoms of anxiety and depression among French university students. More broadly, independent of lockdowns, the COVID-19 pandemic increased anxiety symptoms among French university students. Students increased their physical activity during the first lockdown, but it didn’t sustain over time, even during the second lockdown. The health crisis has led to an increase in sedentary behavior. It is important that universities support students in managing their emotions and lifestyle. In this manuscript, innovative programs developed by the University of Nîmes will be presented.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID) pandemic on the emotions, behavior, and wellness behaviors of first-year college students.
METHOD: A total of 675 first-year university students completed a full assessment of behavioral and emotional functioning at the beginning of the spring semester 2020. Of these, 576 completed the same assessment at the end of the spring semester, 600 completed at least 1 item from a COVID-related survey after the onset of COVID pandemic, and 485 completed nightly surveys of mood and wellness behaviors on a regular basis before and after the onset of the COVID crisis.
RESULTS: Externalizing problems (mean = -0.19, 95\% CI = -0.06 to 0.33, p = .004) and attention problems (mean = -0.60, 95\% CI = -0.40 to 0.80, p {\textless} .001) increased after the onset of COVID, but not internalizing symptoms (mean = 0.18, 95\% CI = -0.1 to 0.38, p = .06). Students who were enrolled in a campus wellness program were less affected by COVID in terms of internalizing symptoms (β = 0.40, SE = 0.21, p = .055) and attention problems (β = 0.59, SE = 0.21, p = .005) than those who were not in the wellness program. Nightly surveys of both mood (β = -0.10, SE = 0.03, p = .003) and daily wellness behaviors (β = -0.06, SE = 0.03, p = .036), but not stress (β = 0.02, SE = 0.03, p = .58), were negatively affected by the COVID crisis. The overall magnitude of these COVID-related changes were modest but persistent across the rest of the semester and different from patterns observed in a prior year.
CONCLUSION: COVID and associated educational/governmental mitigation strategies had a modest but persistent impact on mood and wellness behaviors of first-year university students. Colleges should prepare to address the continued mental health impacts of the pandemic.},

Programs that are cost-effective and time-efficient, that have replicable benefits across samples, are sorely needed. This study aims to examine whether a previously studied acceptance-based behavioral (ABBT) program, the Mindful Way Through the Semester (MWTS), is effective in comparison to a control condition at decreasing levels of depression and enhancing acceptance and academic values when integrated into a first-year undergraduate experience course. The current study also sought to examine the association between change in acceptance, mindfulness practice, and values practice on outcomes. Two hundred thirteen students were assigned to either the MWTS workshop condition or the control condition (in which the first-year experience curriculum as usual was received). Results revealed that the workshop condition produced larger decreases in depression over the course of the semester relative to the control condition, but only for participants endorsing higher levels of depression at baseline. Further, for participants in the workshop condition, changes in depression were negatively associated with changes in acceptance (i.e., larger increases in acceptance associated with larger decreases in depression), an association that was not statistically significant in the control group. Lastly, for participants in the workshop condition who endorsed higher levels of depression at baseline, mindfulness and values practice was associated with greater reductions in depression. Implications of these findings for future interventions are discussed.},

	abstract = {The first wave of behavior therapy countered the excesses and scientific weakness of existing nonempirical clinical traditions through empirically studied first-order change efforts linked to behavioral principles targeting directly relevant clinical targets. The second wave was characterized by similar direct change efforts guided by social learning and cognitive principles that included cognitive in addition to behavioral and emotive targets. Various factors seem to have set the stage for a third wave, including anomalies in the current literature and philosophical changes. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is one of a number of new interventions from both behavioral and cognitive wings that seem to be moving the field in a different direction. ACT is explicitly contextualistic and is based on a basic experimental analysis of human language and cognition, Relational Frame Theory (RFT). RFT explains why cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance are both ubiquitous and harmful. ACT targets these processes and is producing supportive data both at the process and outcome level. The third-wave treatments are characterized by openness to older clinical traditions, a focus on second order and contextual change, an emphasis of function over form, and the construction of flexible and effective repertoires, among other features. They build on the first- and second-wave treatments, but seem to be carrying the behavior therapy tradition forward into new territory.},

	doi = {10.1159/000519366},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in well-being and an increase in mental health problems were registered in medical and psychotherapeutic practices, counseling centers, and clinics. According to previous studies, younger people and women seemed to be particularly affected. The aim of this study was to describe mental health problems of students and to draw consequences for the further handling of pandemics and other crises.
METHOD: Students at the University of Heidelberg, a typical German "full university," were surveyed online using internationally comparable screening instruments like the Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). In addition, the students had the opportunity to describe in a narrative form their well-being and to make suggestions how to improve their situation.
RESULTS: Out of a population of 27,162 students who were contacted by email, 2,137 students completed the questionnaire. The salient finding is that according to the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, 72.2\% of the respondents feel seriously impaired in their well-being. This corresponds to the finding that 75.8\% of the respondents in the PHQ-D show indications of at least one syndrome diagnosis. Depression was found in 41.8\% of the respondents in the PHQ-D. Indications of moderate to severe and severe depressive syndromes were present in 31.8\%. Signs of somatoform syndromes are found in 25.4\% and of anxiety syndromes in 20.0\%. 1,089 students gave narrative reports on how they were feeling and made suggestions for improvement. About 75\% reported severely reduced well-being. Their main complaints were loneliness and depression and lack of recognition for their specific academic and life situation during the pandemic. By far, the largest proportion of students supposed that their mental health issues were caused and/or intensified by the pandemic-related social contact restrictions. The vast majority of them made reasonable suggestions for controlled relaxation of contact restrictions.
CONCLUSIONS: Students suffer severely from the pandemic-related social restriction. In respect to future pandemic outbreaks or other crises leading to social isolation, the dramatic consequences of social lockdowns should be taken into account. Under pandemic conditions, we especially should support persons lacking social networks.},

Searches of the literature identified five randomized experiments that measured improvements in university student well-being as a function of ACT interventions relative to control conditions. A meta-analysis revealed a significant, small pooled effect size on well-being (d = 0.29), providing initial evidence of ACT’s role as a positive psychological intervention among university students. Strengths and limitations of the extant literature are discussed, as are implications of, and future directions for, this area of study.

Both students’ study skills and their well-being should be enhanced in higher education, but effective ways to do this are needed. The aim of this study was to explore students’ experiences of an ACT-based online, 8-week course on university students’ well-being and studying. Data were collected in two ways: a) with qualitative data consisting of learning journals (n = 97) and with b) a pre- and post-questionnaire (n = 143) during the course. The students’ scores on well-being, psychological flexibility, and time and effort management skills improved, and stress levels decreased during the course. Qualitative analyses showed that the students benefited from the course in many ways, both in terms of studying and well-being; their studying and time management skills had improved and they had learnt stress management skills and how to cope with their negative thoughts. We argue that supporting students’ well-being, as well as their study skills with ACT-based course in higher education studies, can lead to more effective studying.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial examined whether KORSA workshops indirectly influence anxiety, depression and stress symptoms among university students through their effect on two second-order psychological flexibility processes: 1) mindfulness and acceptance, and 2) commitment and behavior change. Participants: During the fall 2014 and the winter 2015 semesters, 124 students participated in the study. Methods: They were randomized to either a 4-week intervention group (n = 61) or a wait-list control group (n = 63). They completed measures of anxiety, depression, stress and psychological flexibility before and immediately after the intervention. Results: Bootstrapping-based mediation analyses showed that the intervention indirectly influenced symptoms reduction through its effect on acceptance and mindfulness processes, but not through commitment and behavior change processes. Conclusions: These initial findings suggest that contact with the present moment, acceptance, cognitive defusion and self as context are important processes of change through which KORSA workshops affect the students mental health.},

	abstract = {Stress, anxiety and depression are relatively common problems among university students. This study examined whether an online psychological intervention aiming at enhancing the wellbeing of university students could be an effective and practical alternative for meeting the needs of a university population. University students (N = 68; 85\% female; 19-32 years old) were randomly assigned to either a guided seven-week online Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (iACT) intervention or a waiting list control condition (WLC). A between-groups pre-post (iACT vs WLC) design with 12-month follow-up for the iACT participants was conducted. The intervention participants were offered two face-to-face meetings, completed online exercises during a five-week period, and received personal weekly written feedback via the website from their randomly assigned, trained student coaches. Waitlist participants were offered the intervention program soon after the post measurements. Results in this small efficacy trial showed that the iACT participants had significantly higher gains in wellbeing (between group, d = 0.46), life satisfaction (d = 0.65), and mindfulness skills (d = 0.49). In addition, iACT participants' self-reported stress (d = 0.54) and symptoms of depression (d = 0.69) were significantly reduced compared to the participants in the control group. These benefits were maintained over a 12-month follow-up period (within iACT group, d = 0.65-0.69, for primary measures). The results suggest that an online-based, coach-guided ACT program with blended face-to-face and online sessions could be an effective and well-accepted alternative for enhancing the wellbeing of university students.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Student mental health in higher education has been an increasing concern. The COVID-19 pandemic situation has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students.
METHODS: We conducted interview surveys with 195 students at a large public university in the United States to understand the effects of the pandemic on their mental health and well-being. The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods.
RESULTS: Of the 195 students, 138 (71\%) indicated increased stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple stressors were identified that contributed to the increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive thoughts among students. These included fear and worry about their own health and of their loved ones (177/195, 91\% reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty in concentrating (173/195, 89\%), disruptions to sleeping patterns (168/195, 86\%), decreased social interactions due to physical distancing (167/195, 86\%), and increased concerns on academic performance (159/195, 82\%). To cope with stress and anxiety, participants have sought support from others and helped themselves by adopting either negative or positive coping mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the long-lasting pandemic situation and onerous measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on higher education. The findings of our study highlight the urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address the mental health of college students.},

METHOD: Participants were randomized to intervention (n = 596) or waitlist control (n = 566). Assessment of primary outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress, well-being, self-compassion, life satisfaction, and academic performance) and ACT processes (acceptance, cognitive fusion, education values, valued living, and present moment awareness) occurred at pre- and post-intervention and 12-week follow-up for intervention participants, and the same pre-post interval for waitlist control participants.
RESULTS: Analyses showed significant improvements from pre- to post-intervention compared with waitlist control on all primary outcomes and ACT processes. All intervention gains were maintained at follow-up. Improvements on all primary outcomes were mediated by three or more ACT processes in both samples. Intervention effects were consistent across both sample groupings.
CONCLUSION: Findings provide support for a web-based ACT mental health promotion intervention for university students.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have revealed a high prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms among university students, highlighting an urgent need for preventative measures at low cost to better support often overwhelmed support services.
OBJECTIVE: Here we propose a protocol for assessing the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) for an online transdiagnostic psychoeducational intervention called 'A Bite of ACT' compared with a waitlist control.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an RCT with crossover design involving baseline assessments and two follow-up periods. The primary outcome measure will be the Acceptance Checklist for Clinical Effectiveness Pilot Trials (ACCEPT) for measuring the feasibility of the trial design and methods. Secondary outcomes include measures of well-being, social connectedness, quality of life (EuroQol Five Dimensions), depression, anxiety and stress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21), as well as the process measures: psychological flexibility (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-Second Version and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale) and heart rate variability. Analysis will involve calculating descriptive statistics, examining trial feasibility outcomes through ACCEPT, and determining effect size measures to determine the sample size needed in a future trial (if indicated). Qualitative interviews and preliminary health economics analysis will provide additional insights into the feasibility of the intervention and trial methods.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Department of Psychology Research Ethics Committee in the College of Human and Health Sciences at Swansea University. Dissemination will involve publication in international peer-reviewed journals, presentation of findings at relevant local, national and international conferences, and promotion of study outcomes using social media and other channels for disseminating findings to the wider community.
